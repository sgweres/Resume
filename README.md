# 📚 School Project: Responsive Web Page with HTML & CSS

This project is part of my coursework at Western Governors University, where I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. The goal was to design and build a responsive web page using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structured content using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- **CSS3:** Styled the page with flexbox, pseudo-classes, universal selectors, and custom fonts


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Create a multi-section webpage with a clean layout
- Use different tags to build different sections, features, and functionality
- Explore CSS selectors for dynamic styling and interactivity
