					<h3>My Time with Microsoft</h3>
					<p>
						<span>When I was transitioning out of the Army, I participated in the <mark>Microsoft Software and Systems Academy</mark>, a 17 week course focused on developing Cloud Applications using C#.</span>
						<span>We learned about Azure, data structure and algorithms, and the .NET framework. I created a Windows form application as a job application tracker, that connected to a mySQL database to query for applications I had sent to different companies and enabled me to track them.</span>
